3/ Biological weapons

While German excelled at producing chemical weapons (the deadly tabun and sarin nerve agents were first created by German chemists), Japan excelled at biological weapons, esp germs. Unit 731 was the covert R&D biochemical weapon facility in China. It weaponized bubonic plague, anthrax, cholera and all sorts of nasty bacteria. The Japanese army had employed germs in combats against the Soviets and the Chinese in WW2. It was estimated that more than 100,000 Chinese died as a result of being infected by weaponized germs. In the last months of WW2, the Japanese high command intended to unleash biological weapons against the American civilians on the US West Coast (see Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night). Such an attack could have inflicted enormous casualties and created panic in the US. Fortunately, the attack plan was canceled because General Yoshijiro Umezu feared that:

Germ warfare against the United States would escalate to war against all humanity.

After WW2 ended, the researchers working for Uint 731 were granted immunity from war crime prosecution in exchange for their knowledge and data on the inhumane medical experiments performed on human test subjects. General Shiro Ishii, the director of Unit 731, was even invited to lecture in the US on biological warfare after WW2.
